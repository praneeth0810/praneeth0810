# 👋 Hey, I'm Praneeth 😄  

### 📜 Words of Wisdom  

**Data quality isn't a checklist. It's a culture.**  

But clean, actionable data? That’s the real MVP.  
Everyone wants “data-driven,” but most folks just want a fancy dashboard.  
Me? I engineer the pipeline that makes the insights trustworthy in the first place.
